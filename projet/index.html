    <h1>Building a Custom User Behavior Analytics Tracker for My Portfolio Website</h1>

    <h2>Why Build a Custom Analytics Tracker?</h2>
    <p>As a software developer, I believe the best way to showcase my skills is through meaningful, challenging projects — not just demos or tutorials. For my portfolio website, I'm building a custom user behavior analytics tracker from scratch.</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <p>Most sites rely on third-party tools like Google Analytics, which provide great insights but limit customization and expose data to external services. I want to build something that gives me full control over how data is collected, stored, and analyzed — while demonstrating advanced frontend and backend engineering skills.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>What This Project Is About</h2>
    <p>The core idea is simple:</p>
    <p><strong>Track detailed user interactions on my site — page views, clicks, scroll depth, referrers — then store and analyze this data myself.</strong></p>

    <p>But under the hood, this project will showcase a ton of complex capabilities:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Custom event tracking with precise control over data collected</li>
        <li>Building a lightweight frontend tracking script integrated with WordPress</li>
        <li>Designing a flexible data structure to store diverse event types</li>
        <li>Creating an API to receive and store tracking data securely</li>
        <li>Planning for scalable and performant data analysis features</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Week 1 Focus: Frontend-First, Agile Development</h2>
    <p>I'm kicking off development with a frontend-first approach. The goal is to design and implement a JavaScript tracking library that captures the key user events and sends structured data to a backend API.</p>

    <p>For now, the backend will be a simple mock endpoint that just logs incoming events — no database yet. This lets me test and refine the data collection process early, making sure the event payloads are well-designed and meaningful before building out the storage layer.</p>

    <h2>What I'm Tracking</h2>
    <p>Here are some example events I'm capturing in Week 1:</p>

    <div class="event-list">
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Page Views:</strong> Track when a visitor lands on any page</li>
            <li><strong>Clicks:</strong> Log clicks on important buttons or links (like "Contact Me")</li>
            <li><strong>Scroll Depth:</strong> Measure how far down the page a user scrolls, in percentages</li>
            <li><strong>Referrer:</strong> Capture where the user came from (Google, social media, etc.)</li>
            <li><strong>Session ID:</strong> Assign a unique session ID to group events by visitor</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Why This Matters for Recruiters and Developers</h2>
    <p>This project is more than just code — it's a full-stack demonstration of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Frontend engineering:</strong> Writing clean, efficient, event-driven JavaScript</li>
        <li><strong>API design:</strong> Defining flexible, future-proof data formats</li>
        <li><strong>Agile workflow:</strong> Building iteratively, validating assumptions early</li>
        <li><strong>Problem solving:</strong> Designing for real-world challenges like session tracking and varied event data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What's Next?</h2>
    <p>Once the frontend tracking script is solid, I'll build out the backend database layer — leveraging the existing WordPress MySQL database by adding custom tables to store events efficiently. Then, I'll develop visualization tools to analyze user behavior directly on my site.</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <p>I'm excited to share this journey and showcase the technical depth behind building something that many take for granted. Stay tuned for updates!</p>
